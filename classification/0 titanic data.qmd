# load package

```{python}
import os
#os.system('pip install xgboost')
```

# data

## download data

https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

## input data

```{python}
# Loading the data
df_train = pd.read_csv('./data/train.csv')
df_test = pd.read_csv('./data/test.csv')

# Store our test passenger IDs for easy access
PassengerId = df_train['PassengerId']


# Showing overview of the train dataset
df_train.head()

```

## data EDA

```{python}
df_train.describe()
```

```{python}
df_train.describe(include=[object])
```

Missing Data

```{python}
df_train.isnull().sum()
```

```{python}
import seaborn as sns
sns.catplot(x='Survived', col='Sex', kind='count', data=df_train);
```

```{python}
import sweetviz as sv
my_report = sv.analyze(df_train)
```

```{python}
my_report.show_notebook()
```

## feature vs target

```{python}
my_report2 = sv.analyze(df_train,target_feat='Survived')
```

```{python}
my_report2.show_notebook()
```

## compare train data and test data

```{python}
compare = sv.compare(source=df_train, compare=df_test)
```

```{python}
compare.show_notebook()
```

## data dictionary

pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES) 1st = Upper 2nd = Middle 3rd = Lower

age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...

Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister

Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...

Parent = mother, father

Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
